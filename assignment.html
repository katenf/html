    <p>I am Kate Nyarko Fordjour, a first year <strong>Biomedical Engineering</strong>
        student. I am 19 years old and an alumna of <span style="color:rgb(30, 231, 30);">Saint Louis 
            Senior High School.</span> I live at Bremang , a town in the city of <strong>Kumasi.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Growing up, I wanted t0 become a <em>Cardiologist </em> so I pursued general science as a course in S.H.S.
        Along the line I got to know and understand myself better.I discovered more exciting aspects of science like ;
        <u>Physics and Chemistry .</u> It wasn't until third year in senior high that i gotto know about <strong> Biomedical engineering</strong>
 e   .By then, I had taken am interest in engineering.I still liked medicine though.I only got toknow about biomed because my physics teacher encouraged me to pursue that.
    </p>
    <p> I researched about the progrram and started making enquiries from my teachers.I came to a conclusion after a lot of research that,I wanted to pursue Biomedical Engineering.
    I chose biomedical engineering because I was fascinated about how engineering princinciples are utilised in solving problems in healthcare and how treatment of diseases have improved due to 
        Biomedical engineering. I believe there will be more positive transformations in healthcare with Biomedical engineering and I want to be part of that.
