    <p>I am Kate Nyarko Fordjour, a first year <strong>Biomedical Engineering</strong>
        student. I am 19 years old and an alumna of <span style="color:rgb(30, 231, 30);">Saint Louis 
            Senior High School.</span>I chose Biomedical Engineering because I want to acquire knowledge to
            bridge the gap between <em> Engineering </em>and <em>Healthcare</em>.
